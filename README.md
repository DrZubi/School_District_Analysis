# School-District-Analysis
### Submission by Omar Zu'bi

## Project Overview
Evidence of academic dishonesty in testing scores were found for Thomas High School 9th grade students and has prompted a analysis of the reassessed scores. The math and reading scores for Thomas High School 9th grader's were replaced with NaNs while keeping the rest of the school's data intact. A school district analysis was conducted once again and a writeup describing how these changes affected the overall analysis are provided in the report. 

## Resources Included in Repository
Software:
* Python 3.7.10
* Jupyter Notebook

Files Included sources: 
* [school_complete.csv](Resources/school_complete.csv) 
* [students_complete.csv](Resources/students_complete.csv)

## Results

* How is the district summary affected?
The reassessment has proven that Thomas High School performance in all averages (math, reading, and overall) has decreased by a small margin (0.1% - 0.3%). This indicates that the ninth-grade scores of Thomas High School were close to the school's average, and by removing the compromised scores, had minimal effect on the school's overall performance.
